## Installation Notes for running locally

1. Clone the repository

```sh
# clone to current directory; change dir
git clone https://github.com/UM-USElab/gradecraft-development.git
cd gradecraft-development
```

2. Copy configuration files
```sh
# Note: ensure that you are in the newly cloned /gradecraft-development dir
cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
cp config/mongoid.yml.sample config/mongoid.yml
cp .env.sample .env

# obtain and replace required credentials for .env (AWS, etc.)

# comment out ALL SAML and IDP-related lines
```

3. Install Homebrew (Optional: `brew update`)

4. Install a Ruby version manager of your choice and set current version to project version (Steps below pertain to [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))

```sh
brew install rbenv

# run command and follow instructions, will likely be the next step where you edit ~/.bash_profile
rbenv init

# make rbenv start up with terminal
edit ~/.bash_profile and add eval "$(rbenv init -)"

# optional (rbenv doctor script to check installation)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash

# install and set the current version
rbenv install 2.5.1 (or whatever version Gradecraft is on)
rbenv local 2.5.1 (or rbenv global 2.5.1 if preferred)

# Restart terminal for changes to fully take into effect and ensure that the command rbenv works
```

5. Install databases

```sh
brew install mongodb
brew install redis
brew install postgresql
```

6. Ensure access to `/data/db` write directory for MongodDB
```sh
# create the directory, if it does not exist
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chown -R {user} /data/db (replace user; can ls -l to determine value)

# (optional) mongod command should bring up mongodb; close with ctrl+c before proceeding to step 5
```

7. Install Bundler
```sh
# install Bundler version specified in Gemfile.lock to avoid conflicts
gem install bundler -v 1.17.1
```

8. Install project dependencies
```sh
bundle (or bundle install)
```

9. Start Postgres database and ensure it is running on port `5432` (Optional: Download and run with [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) for Mac OS)

10. Create and populate databases with sample data

```sh
bundle exec rails db:create

# optional
bundle exec rails db:sample
```

11. Done! Run `foreman start` to begin

### Additional Notes

* Don't `sudo gem install`, as it will install gems in a way that does not work properly with `rbenv`. If using `rbenv` as the version manager, you may need to ensure that proper read/write permissions are granted for `/Users/{user}/.rbenv`

* See db/samples.rb for dev usernames and passwords

## Testing Emails Locally

1. `gem install mailcatcher`
2. Run `mailcatcher` in terminal
3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:1080`. Emails are routed through to the web interface.

Modify action_mailer config settings in development.rb if needed

## Linting code

Note: Both rubocop and coffeelint are installed directly on your machine, as they are
not required for development, and thus are not specified within the gemfile or node package.

### To lint ruby:

Install rubocop:

`gem install rubocop`

then

`$ rubocop [path/to/file.rb]`

### To lint coffeescript:

Install coffeelint:

`npm install -g coffeelint`

to lint all files in `javascripts/`

`rake lint:js`

to lint a directory:

`coffeelint -f coffeelint.json path/to/directory`

to lint a single file:

`coffeelint -f coffeelint.json path/to/file.coffee`

### To lint javascript:

Install jslint:

`npm install -g eslint`

to lint the javacripts directory:

`eslint ./app/assets/javascripts --ext .js`

## Running specs

To run all of the spec examples, you can run the following (this is also the default rake task):

```sh
bundle exec rails spec
```

To run all of the spec examples with code coverage, you can run the following:

```sh
bundle exec rails spec:coverage
```
