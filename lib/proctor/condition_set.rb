require_relative "condition_set/defer"

# Conditions are an optional layer on top of the Proctor class that adds
# flexibility for how and where various behaviors for any given Proctor
# subclass are defined. The problem that this attempts to solve is the
# definition of Proctor behaviors such as SomeProctor.showable? by simply
# constructing laundry lists of comparisons nested within if-else statements
# inside of a single method.
#
# Conditions separate these concerns out into requirements and overrides,
# both of which inherit from Proctor::Condition and are fundamentally wrappers
# for comparisons which are later called as a block to determine outcome.
#
# By standardizing this format we can use helpers like #satisfied_by?,
# requirements_passed?, and valid_overrides_present? to determine the status
# of a given set of conditions in various states.
#
# This module should be included in a Conditions class that corresponds to the
# Proctor that is using the set of conditions. For example a FooProctor class
# might use a FooConditions class to handle its logical concerns:
#
# class FooProctor < Proctor
#   def initialize(foo)
#     @foo = foo
#   end
#
#   def viewable_by?(user)
#     FooConditions.new(foo).for(:show).satisfied_by? user
#   end
# end
#
# class FooConditionSet
#   include Proctor::ConditionSet
#
#   def show_conditions
#     add_requirement :foo_equals_bar
#     add_override :bar_equals_bar
#   end
#
#   def foo_equals_bar
#     "foo" == "bar"
#   end
#
#   def bar_equals_bar
#     "bar" == "bar"
#   end
# end
#
