Hello, #{@user.first_name}

Welcome to GradeCraft!

Thank you for adding GradeCraft to your course!  GradeCraft is a tool built
at the University of Michigan that facilitates teaching from a gameful
perspective.  Some highlights of how we do things differently:

As you begin to explore and build your course,
we wanted to share some resources to help:

*Students' grades start from zero and build up
*Students can predict and track their grades
*Create assessment paths for students or allow them to create their own
*Integrates with Canvas to import grades from quizzes or used as a
standalone gradebook.
